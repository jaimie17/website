            <p>I am a recent graduate of Brandeis University with a major in Computer Science (B.S.) and minors in Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Studies and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGS). 
                I was treasurer for the Brandeis Disabled Students' Network (DSN) and am committed to accessibility, inclusivity, and diversity. 
                I have a passion for UX design, web development, and 3D animation, and hope to use my skills for positive change. Currently, I am looking for opportunities in computer-science-related areas.</p>
                <p>I have experience in Python, Java, and HTML/CSS, and am learning more about cybersecurity and web development.
                In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and arts and crafts.</p>
